#### Understanding this report:

The plot on the left displays the average time per iteration for this benchmark. The shaded region
shows the estimated probability of an iteration taking a certain amount of time, while the line
shows the mean. Click on the plot for a larger view showing the outliers.

The plot on the right shows the linear regression calculated from the measurements. Each point
represents a sample, though here it shows the total time for the sample rather than time per
iteration. The line is the line of best fit for these measurements.
